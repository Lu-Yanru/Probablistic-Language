Programming Language: WebPPL

The contents are largely based on the XPrag summer course "Probabilistic Pragmatics" in Berlin 2019 taught by Judith Degen,

and the web-textbook:

G. Scontras, M. H. Tessler, and M. Franke (2018). Probabilistic language understanding: An introduction to the Rational Speech Act framework. Retrieved 2019-8-11 from https://www.problang.org.

Please see http://forestdb.org/ for a repository for probabilistic models.

http://webppl.org/ is an online editor for WebPPL, you can try out the codes there.

All mistakes are due to the possibility that I did not understand it right.
